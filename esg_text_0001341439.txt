2023-06-20 We develop the substantial majority of our products and services offerings internally utilizing the skills and diversity of a global workforce. In addition, we have extended our products and services offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. However, although we believe that our patents have value, neither our business as a whole nor any of our principal businesses are materially dependent on a single patent. Rapid technological advances in cloud, software and hardware development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current products and services offerings.
At Oracle, our success is driven by the quality of our people, who we believe are among the best and brightest in the industry. We strive to attract and retain talented employees, to support employee success and well-being and to foster a culture where everyone has a voice in driving innovation. Our Board of Directors oversees diversity and inclusion (D&I) matters and the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and monitoring matters related to human capital management, including talent acquisition and retention.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that D&I powers innovation and that the diversity of our workforce is critical to helping our customers solve difficult problems. Our focus on D&I is reflected throughout our organization, starting at the highest level. Our Chief Executive Officer is a woman and forty percent of the members of our Board of Directors are women and/or come from a diverse background. We endeavor to hire employees from a broad pool of talent with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and abilities and we believe Oracle’s leaders serve as role models for our diverse and inclusive workforce. We strive to enable our employees to further their careers, build their networks and foster the skills needed to succeed at Oracle, including through participation in our Employee Resource Groups, which offer employees opportunities to engage in mentor relationships and further develop diverse leaders and employees at Oracle. We seek to continuously build on our inclusive hiring strategies, tracking our progress and holding ourselves accountable for greater diversity at Oracle. Our programs are supported by Oracle leaders across the company with strategic sponsorship from Oracle’s Executive Diversity Council, which is led by Safra Catz, our Chief Executive Officer, and extend through the actions we are taking globally on Oracle’s five D&I Imperatives:
recruiting with an intention on diversity;
investing in the future diversity of our industry.
We are proud to be recognized for our ongoing progress and commitment to D&I. Examples of recognition received include being named one of the World’s Top Female-Friendly Companies and one of America’s Best Employers For Women by Forbes in 2022 and one of America’s Best Employers For Diversity by Forbes in 2023; a Best Place to Work by the Disability Equality Index in 2022 for the fifth consecutive year; a 2022 Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality

Our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well as local testing and labeling requirements. Compliance with these ever-changing environmental and other laws in a timely manner could increase our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delivery, cloud operations and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our sales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses. Regulatory, market, and competitive pressures regarding the greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations may also grow.
We have an Environmental Steering Committee (ESC) comprised of senior individuals from a wide range of Oracle business units, including our Chief Sustainability Officer who oversees our overall sustainability strategy, including climate related risk mitigation. The ESC evaluates if climate or environmental risks have the potential for significant chronic or acute impact on our core and/or strategic business functions, including service delivery and support, product development and deployment, supply chain management, facility operations, employee recruitment and retention, or brand reputation. A failure by the ESC to identify and assess these risks could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance and growth.
Further, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and formalized in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, which may require specific, target-driven frameworks or disclosure requirements. For example, in the U.S., the SEC has proposed rules requiring, among other things, disclosure of public companies’ climate-related strategies, costs,

A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China’s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, among others, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The UK Government has announced a procurement policy that includes environmental, social and economic sustainability measures.

On December 7, 2020, plaintiffs filed a consolidated derivative complaint against all members of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, interest, corporate governance changes, disgorgement, restitution, punitive damages, and an award of attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and costs. Plaintiffs allege that: (a) defendants breached their fiduciary duties by permitting Oracle to violate anti-discrimination laws and Oracle’s own policies, failing to ensure sufficient diversity on the board, failing to ensure an independent board chairman, rehiring Ernst & Young LLP as Oracle’s auditors, and by breaching the HP Settlement Agreement (discussed above); (b)  defendants made false and misleading statements in Oracle’s proxy statements; (c) defendants received unjust compensation and were unjustly enriched; (d) defendants aided and abetted this conduct; and (e) our Chief Technology Officer and our Chief Executive Officer are liable for abuse of control. On January 6, 2021, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On May 24, 2021, the court granted defendants’ motion. Regarding the claims concerning Oracle’s proxy statements, the court granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint within 30 days. Regarding the remaining claims, the court granted plaintiffs leave to re-file those claims in Delaware Chancery Court.
