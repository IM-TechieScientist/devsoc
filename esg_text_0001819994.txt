2023-03-07 Unprecedented commercial investment and government expenditures are driving rapid growth in the space economy. As one of select few commercial companies delivering regular access to orbit, our proven launch vehicle, spacecraft technology and global infrastructure uniquely position us to grow this dynamic market. Advances in technologies, materials and components have led to miniaturization of spacecraft and a significant reduction in cost and time-to-market, concurrent with the increase in demand for space applications such as communications, remote sensing, Earth observation, meteorology and navigation. We provide customers with frequent, reliable and cost-effective access to orbit for this new generation of small spacecraft with Electron, a fully carbon composite launch vehicle powered by Rutherford, our electric turbopump 3D printed engines. Since our first Electron launch in 2017 through December 31, 2022, we have delivered 152 spacecraft to space across 29 successful orbital missions for commercial and government customers, including the United States (“U.S.”) Department of Defense (“DoD”), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”) and the National Reconnaissance Office (“NRO”), and a number of domestic and international commercial spacecraft operators including Blacksky Holdings, Canon, Kinéis, Capella Space, Planet, OHB Group and Synspective. In 2022, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and maintained us as the fourth most frequent launcher globally.
Carbon composite tanks and structures, delivering substantial mass-savings while maintaining strong structural integrity;
Electron is our orbital small launch vehicle that was designed to accommodate a high launch cadence business model to meet the growing and dynamic needs of our customers for small spacecraft launch services. Combining the use of innovative manufacturing technologies, including 3D printing and automation, Electron is optimized for rapid and frequent launch and has established itself as one of the most prolific and reliable launch vehicles in the market. Since its maiden launch in 2017, Electron has become the leading small spacecraft launch vehicle delivering 152 spacecraft to orbit for government and commercial customers across 29 successful orbital missions through December 31, 2022. In 2022, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States, and established Rocket Lab as the fourth most frequent launcher globally. Our launch services program has seen us develop many industry-leading innovations, including 3D printed electric turbo-pump rocket engines, fully carbon composite fuel tanks, a private orbital launch complex, a kick stage that can be configured to convert into a highly capable spacecraft on orbit, and the potential ability to successfully recover a stage from space, providing a path to reusability.
Electron provides tailored access to orbit for the high-growth small spacecraft market across dedicated and rideshare missions. It is capable of deploying spacecraft of up to 300 kg to low Earth orbit across a wide range of orbital inclinations from 38 to 120 degrees from our operational LC-1 in Mahia New Zealand and a wide range of orbital inclinations from 38 to 60 degrees from our operational LC-2 in Wallops Island, Virginia. Electron is also capable of delivering spacecraft to deep space and interplanetary destinations, a capability which we successfully demonstrated with the launch of a NASA mission to the Moon in support of the agency’s Artemis program, Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (“CAPSTONE”). Electron has two primary stages and an innovative third kick stage, standing at 18 meters tall, with a diameter of 1.2 meters and a lift-off mass of approximately 14,000 kg. Electron’s design includes innovative use of avionics and electrical systems, and advanced carbon-composites for its structures and propellant tanks. Carbon-composite construction decreases mass by as much as 40 percent relative to other materials, contributing to Electron’s mass-to-orbit performance. Our in-house assembly of Electron’s composite tanks and structures improves cost efficiency and supports high rates of production. Electron’s kick stage enables the spacecraft to be placed in circular orbits, which is necessary for a spacecraft to maintain consistent altitude and is capable of engine restarts to deliver multiple payloads to a range of orbits, meeting precise orbit insertion requirements, and deorbiting to avoid contributing to orbital debris, also known as space junk.
Electron is propelled by a total of ten Rutherford engines that we manufacture at our headquarters in Long Beach, California. The Rutherford engine is a 5,600-lbf engine fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene fed by electric turbo-pumps and is based on a propulsion cycle that makes use of electric motors and high-performance lithium polymer batteries to drive liquid oxygen and kerosene fuel pumps. Electric turbo-pumps are lower complexity than the turbomachinery typically required for gas generator cycles, yet still achieve high efficiency. We believe our Rutherford engine is the first oxygen/hydrocarbon engine to use additive manufacturing for all primary components, including the regeneratively cooled thrust chamber, injector pumps and main valves.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Diversity unlocks innovation. Different experiences, knowledge, and cultures come together to generate new ways of doing things and new ideas, and we’re committed to attracting and engaging a global team that reflects the diversity of the missions we launch and the communities where we live and work. At the internship level, Rocket Lab has set a target of 50% women in its annual internship intake. Rocket Lab is also a host institution for the Brooke Owens Fellowship, which provides paid internships and executive mentorship for undergraduate women and gender-minority students in aerospace. Our workplace culture places priority on people feeling welcomed, valued, and respected, and we’ve backed this commitment with goals, policies, and initiatives to increase women and minority hires throughout our teams.

Since its maiden launch in 2017, Electron has become the leading small spacecraft launch vehicle delivering 152 spacecraft to orbit for government and commercial customers across 29 successful orbital missions through December 31, 2022. In 2022, Electron was the second most frequently launched rocket by companies operating in the United States, and established Rocket Lab as the fourth most frequent launcher globally. Our launch services program has seen us develop many industry-leading innovations, including 3D printed electric turbo-pump rocket engines, fully carbon composite fuel tanks, a private orbital launch complex, a kick stage that can be configured to convert into a highly capable spacecraft on orbit, and the potential ability to successfully recover a stage from space, providing a path to reusability.
Electron provides tailored access to orbit for the high-growth small spacecraft market across dedicated and rideshare missions. It is capable of deploying spacecraft of up to 300 kg to low Earth orbit across a wide range of orbital inclinations from 38 to 120 degrees from our operational LC-1 in Mahia New Zealand and a wide range of orbital inclinations from 38 to 60 degrees from our operational LC-2 in Wallops Island, Virginia. Electron is also capable of delivering spacecraft to deep space and interplanetary destinations, a capability which we successfully demonstrated with the launch of a NASA mission to the Moon in support of the agency’s Artemis program, Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (“CAPSTONE”). Electron has two primary stages and an innovative third kick stage, standing at 18 meters tall, with a diameter of 1.2 meters and a lift-off mass of approximately 14,000 kg. Electron’s design includes innovative use of avionics and electrical systems, and advanced carbon-composites for its structures and propellant tanks. Carbon-composite construction decreases mass by as much as 40 percent relative to other materials, contributing to Electron’s mass-to-orbit performance. Our in-house assembly of Electron’s composite tanks and structures improves cost efficiency and supports high rates of production. Electron’s kick stage enables the spacecraft to be placed in circular orbits, which is necessary for a spacecraft to maintain consistent altitude and is capable of engine restarts to deliver multiple payloads to a range of orbits, meeting precise orbit insertion requirements, and deorbiting to avoid contributing to orbital debris, also known as space junk.
Electron is propelled by a total of ten Rutherford engines that we manufacture at our headquarters in Long Beach, California. The Rutherford engine is a 5,600-lbf engine fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene fed by electric turbo-pumps and is based on a propulsion cycle that makes use of electric motors and high-performance lithium polymer batteries to drive liquid oxygen and kerosene fuel pumps. Electric turbo-pumps are lower complexity than the turbomachinery typically required for gas generator cycles, yet still achieve high efficiency. We believe our Rutherford engine is the first oxygen/hydrocarbon engine to use additive manufacturing for all primary components, including the regeneratively cooled thrust chamber, injector pumps and main valves.
